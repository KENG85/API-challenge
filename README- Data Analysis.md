#Observable Data Trends

Global Temperature was found to be negatively correlated with latitude (r2 = -0.69) ; With largest portion of earth land mass being principally located above -40 degrees latitude, we can see that equatorial city tempertures are greater temperatures for the absolute values of higher latitudes. This trend becomes more apparent when we look at hemispheric tempheratures. The Northern hemispheric temperatures show a strong negative correlation with latitude, r2 = -0.91. Conversly a positive correlation can be observed for the southern hemisphere as latitudes of -60 approach the equator. Southern hemispheric temperatures show a strong positive correlation with latitude of r2 = 0.74.

Cloudiness and windspeed and humidity are not correlated with latitude. When examined hemispherically, Northern hemispheric r2 values for cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity are slightly stronger although not significat at r2 = 0.17, 0.25, 0.24 respectively. Southern hemispheric r2 values for cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity are 0.15, 0.37, and -0.43 respectively. Stronger r2 values are observed for Southern hemispheric Wind speed and humidiy, and approach significant r2 values with latitude but remain less than 50% significance.

Global Humity and Cloudiness show a slight but not significant positive correlation (r2 = 0.30). Neither Humidity nor cloudiness was correlated with latitude.
